# genmenu
## INTRO
A tiny cli python 3 script to generate a weekly meal menu.
## Why
For me it's quite an effort every week to plan the dinners.
This is an attempt to automate it.
## Example
See `genmenu_script.py.example`

```
$ python3 genmenu_script.py.example

Dinner: Dinner 1

Tuesday

Dinner: Dinner 2

Wednesday
Lunch: Lunch 3
Dinner: Dinner 3

Thursday

Dinner: Dinner 4

Friday

Saturday
